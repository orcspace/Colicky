# Outlook

Outlook tools run through the `composio` server.

## Find mail
- Whole mailbox by words/sender/recipient: `OUTLOOK_SEARCH_MESSAGES {query: "from:a@example.com AND subject:\"Q3 plan\" AND received>=2030-03-01", size: 25}`. The id to use next is `hits[].hitId` (not `resource.id`). Page with `from_index += 25` while `moreResultsAvailable`.
- One folder: `OUTLOOK_LIST_MESSAGES {folder, top: 50, filter: "isRead eq false and receivedDateTime ge 2030-03-03T00:00:00Z"}`. `top` defaults to 10, and `from_address` / `has_attachments` / `subject_contains` only filter that page: a sender not in the first 10 looks absent. Use `filter` or SEARCH. Page with `data.next_page_token` → `page_token` until it's gone. Bodies aren't included: `OUTLOOK_GET_MESSAGE {message_id}`.
- Custom folders need ids from `OUTLOOK_LIST_MAIL_FOLDERS` (well-known: `inbox`, `sentitems`, `drafts`, `archive`). `OUTLOOK_MOVE_MESSAGE` returns a NEW message id; use it afterwards.

## Drafts (the default for anything outgoing)
- Reply to the sender: `OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT_REPLY {message_id, comment}` on the latest message of the thread (a message id, not `conversationId`). Reply-all: `OUTLOOK_CREATE_ME_MESSAGE_REPLY_ALL_DRAFT {user_id: "me", message_id, comment}`.
- New mail: `OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT {subject, body, to_recipients: ["a@example.com"]}`; `is_html` is false, so HTML shows as literal tags.
- `OUTLOOK_REPLY_EMAIL`, `OUTLOOK_SEND_EMAIL`, `OUTLOOK_SEND_DRAFT`, `OUTLOOK_FORWARD_MESSAGE` send at once: only after the user approved that exact draft (recipients, subject and body). Never delete mail unless asked; "trash" is a move to `deleteditems`.
- `OUTLOOK_UPDATE_EMAIL` `to_recipients` / `categories` replace the whole list: resend existing ones to add.

## Calendar and time zones
- "What's on today": `OUTLOOK_GET_CALENDAR_VIEW {start_datetime: "2030-03-03T00:00:00-05:00", end_datetime: "2030-03-04T00:00:00-05:00", timezone: "America/New_York"}`. The window uses the offset in the strings (none = UTC); `timezone` only sets how times come back (default UTC). It expands recurring meetings; `OUTLOOK_LIST_EVENTS` returns series masters unless `expand_recurring_events: true`.
- Returned `start.dateTime` has no offset; read it with `start.timeZone`. The user's zone comes from their notes, else `OUTLOOK_GET_MAILBOX_SETTINGS`.
- Hold: `OUTLOOK_CALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT {subject, start_datetime: "2030-03-03T10:00:00", end_datetime, time_zone: "America/New_York"}` (local time, no offset). Any `attendees_info` sends invites: add people only when asked.
- `OUTLOOK_UPDATE_CALENDAR_EVENT {event_id, …}` keeps unspecified fields, but `attendees` replaces the list and changes notify attendees. Deleting a meeting you organize cancels it for everyone.

## Check before you say done
Read it back (`OUTLOOK_GET_MESSAGE` / `OUTLOOK_GET_EVENT`): recipients, thread, times in the user's zone. Give its `webLink`. Say "drafted", not "sent".
